How the Web Works
<div>
  <div class="concept-description">
    <p>The web is a bunch of computers that communicate
    with each other. Users on computers with web browsers (is FOX, Safari, Chrome....) connect to web server host via the internet. Web server host contain HTML files which are sent back to the users when requestd.</p>

HTML
<div>
  <div class="concept-description">
    <p>HTML stands for <em>Hypertext Markup Language.</em> HTML documents form the majority of the
    content on the web. HTML documents contain <em>text content</em> which describes "what you see"
    and <em>markup</em> which describes "how it looks".</p>

Tags
<div>
  <div class="concept-description">
    <p>HTML tags are the hidden keywords within a web page that define how the browser must format and display the content. Most tags must have two parts, an opening and a closing part. For example, <html> is the opening tag and </html> is the closing tag. </p>

Elements
<div>
  <div class="concept-description">
    <p>An HTML element is an individual component of an HTML document or web page, once this has been parsed into the Document Object Model. HTML is composed of a tree of HTML elements and other nodes, such as text nodes. Each element can have HTML attributes specified.</p>

Inline Block Elements
<div>
  <div class="concept-description">
    <p>You can create a grid of boxes that fills the browser width and wraps nicely. This has been possible for a long time using float , but now with <em>inline-block</em> it's even easier. <em> Inline-block </em> elements are like inline elements but they can have a width and height. </p>
  </div>
  </div>

  <div class="concept">
  <div class="concept-title">
Block Elements
<div>
  <div class="concept-description">
    <p>A block level element that can be used as a container for other HTML elements. The element has no special meaning. It has no required attributes, but style and class are common. Because it is a block level element, the browser will display line breaks before and after it. </p>

Why Computers are Stupid
<div>
  <div class="concept-description">
    <p>Computers are only as smart as the programs that it contains.  One's and Zero's.  They take code literaly.  Any errors in coding make the pomputer to stupid.</p>

Developer Tools

  <div class="concept-description">
    <p>Elements are either <b>Inline</b> or <b>block</b>.Block elements form an "invisible box" around the content inside of them.</p>

  <div class="concept-title">
Tree like Structure of HTML
<div>
  <div class="concept-description">
    <p>HTML documents form a tree structure that starts at "the root" and branches to "the leaves".  This shows up in the browser as a seriese of nested boxes.  Boxes in side of boxes.</p>

Relationship Between Indented HTML and Boxes
<div>
  <div class="concept-description">
    <p>The boxes show the relationship  of boxes nested inside of boxes. </p>

Text Editors
<div>
  <div class="concept-description">
    <p>Text editors are simple low-frills test editored made to help programmers generated code more easier.   <em>Sublime</em> is a good example.  Some editores will automatically make correections to your errors</p>

  <div class="concept-title">
Divs and Spams
<div>
  <div class="concept-description">
    <p>The <em>div</em> tag is nothing more than a container unit that encapsulates other page elements and divides the HTML document into sections. Web developers use <em>div</em> elements to group together HTML elements and apply CSS styles to many elements at once. For instance, by wrapping a set of paragraph elements into a <em>div</em> element, the developer can take advantage of CSS styles and apply a font to all paragraphs at once by applying a font style to the <em>div</em> tag instead of coding the same style for each paragraph element.</p>
    <p>The HTML <span> element is a generic inline container for phrasing content, which does not inherently represent anything. It can be used to group elements for styling purposes (using the class or id attributes), or because they share attribute values, such semantic element is appropriate. ,=<em>span</em> is very much like a div element, but div is a block-level element whereas a <em>span</em> is an inline element.  It should be used only when no other</p>

Box Model
<div>
  <div class="concept-description">
    <p>All HTML elements can be considered as boxes. In CSS, the term "box model" is used when talking about design and layout.  The CSS box model is essentially a box that wraps around HTML elements, and it consists of: margins, borders, padding, and the actual content.  The box model allows us to add a border around elements, and to define space between elements.</p>

<h2>Adding CSS Style to HTML Structure</h2>

  <div class="concept-title">
Style
<div>
  <div class="concept-description">
    <p>The <em>style</em> of an HTML element is a bunch of rules which describe how that element should look. This style can be specified in a CSS file.</p>

  <div class="concept-title">
Avioding Repetition
<div>
  <div class="concept-description">
    <p>Avoid repetition when programming. If you give the same style to similar elements, you can reap the benefits of this when you quickly and easily modify all of them at once just by changing a single line of CSS.</p>
